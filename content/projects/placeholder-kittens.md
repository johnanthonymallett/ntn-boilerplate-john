Between analog and digital interfaces, what is lost and gained? The disillusionment of post-digital user experiences has motivated contemporary visual cultures to re-interpret the value of analog mediums. 'intent' is an experimental publication that brings together stories of digital disruption from the archives of Audio Culture, Iwi Waiataâ€”celebrating the challenges that shaped the contemporary music experience in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Audio, Typography and the affordances of print and digital formats are staged through interactive outputs.
