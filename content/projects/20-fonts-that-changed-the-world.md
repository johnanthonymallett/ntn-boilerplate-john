The book ’20 Fonts that changed the world’, is an editorial project which traces a selection of historically relevant and popularly commercialised fonts. They are categorised by the vernacular of typesetting technologies which influenced their production and use. It reflects on a series of fonts which have been adapted throughout history. Some of them have been given a new contextual value in each instance of technological revival. These categories are Classic, Modern and Contemporary. The use of negative space and black and white throughout the book is to accentuate the forms of the letters and their use in context.
