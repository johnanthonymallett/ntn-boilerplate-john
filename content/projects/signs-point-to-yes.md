[](<w﻿ww.signspointtoyes.xyz>)Signs Point To Yes situates three artistic practices and a design practice along a continuum of ecologies. At once an archive, facing into circuits of time, and a crystal ball, speculating towards the future, the show embraces a temporal fluidity. Is the past as immovable as it seems? What is shimmering just out of sight? Are we being haunted?

The show is a collection of audio and visual works, paintings, and sculptural works. From this scope of digital and physical mediums, a conversation around permanence and form emerges. In some artworks, a singular moment is stretched to extremes – in other works, whole geologic epochs are contained within small objects. The show animates and summons; lost things – dead or nonliving things – forgotten things – they gather here and speak softly.
